# Prework Study Guide Webpage
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help boot camp students succeed in learning how to code. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this project because learning to code is hard! And also because I learn by doing. There is a lot of information to process, and this is my attempt to curate and corral all that into one easy place for continued study. In creating this website, I learned about Github and Gitlab, I started using Terminal (aka command line) and VS Code, and I realized that I am indeed capable to learning new things.
